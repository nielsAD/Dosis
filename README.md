Adds a `TreeMap` tab to the file properties dialog in Windows Explorer. This tab displays an interactive [treemap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping) visualization of the directory layout according to the relative size of files and folders. The following gif displays the treemap for a directory called `MinGW`:

The tab is visible when at least one directory **or** multiple files are selected. Left click on a directory in the treemap zooms in. Zooming out is done with a right mouse click or a click on the ellipses in the upper left corner.
